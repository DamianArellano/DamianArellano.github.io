I am majoring in computer science at CSUF, with plans of graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2

    I enjoyed lab two because we created a Mad Libs game using strings. As someone who hopes to develop games in the future, making this work was very fun. Though it was very simple, it was still enjoyable.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was challenging, and I worked with someone who was clearly much more experienced than I was. We used for loops to find an average of scores, and we created a knitting pattern in part 2. While I know how loops work and how to write them, the execution was much harder, mainly due to the variables. It helped me remember that I still have a lot to learn and motivated me to program more often on my free time, which I did start doing!

* Lab 11

    This lab was pretty refreshing, as it was only a one parter after the frequent part two. We combined a lot of what we had learned from previous labs, and it was rewarding to be able to get it done early.
